- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cthulu-dot-eth. I'm an Icelandic-Swedish Ethereum, ENS, Web3-enthusiast and an ENS-delegate.
Apart from tech I love popcorn, books and cartoons :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 and Cryptocurrencies with a main focus on Ethereum and ENS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and economics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting or fun Web3/Ethereum/Crypto-projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at cthulu.eth at protonmail dot com or in the ENS Discord at https://chat.ens.domains where I'm a support mod. Come say hi!
